# CprE288 -Embedded Systems
These labs were ran using a programmable Irobot "Roomba". All of the labs were combined at the end to build a robot that would traverse through a maze while providing a map of what obstacles it is seeing and information on where the "Landing point" is.

Lab 1-INTRODUCTION TO CODE COMPOSER STUDIO AND THE CYBOT PLATFORM

Lab 2-IROBOT OPEN INTERFACE AND MOVEMENT
