# CprE288 -Embedded Systems
These labs were ran using a programmable Irobot "Roomba". All of the labs were combined at the end to build a robot that would traverse through a maze while providing a map of what obstacles it is seeing and information on where the "Landing point" is.

Lab 1- Introduction to Code Composer Studio and Cyrobot platform

Lab 2-IRobot open interface and movement

Lab 3- Push buttons: Polling and Interrupts

Lab 4- Asychnronus Serial Communication

Lab 5- Data Analysis
 
Lab 6-IR distance measurment

Lab 7- Ping- Distance Measurment

Lab 8-Servo Motorposition and control

Lab 9-Object Detection and anaysis
